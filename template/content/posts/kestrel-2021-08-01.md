*Let's do a
[Kestrel](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang) hunting
practice of backward and forward tracking on a Windows host to unearth the root
cause and impacts of activities related to an IP address. We walk the process
tree and its extended parts such as network traffic and IP addresses. We use
both pattern matching and analytics hunting steps are chain them into
huntflows.*

### <a name="section:setup"></a>Kestrel Installation And Monitoring System Setup

We follow the Kestrel installation and Windows monitor setup procedures
described in our blog [Building A Huntbook to Discovery Persistent Threats from
Scheduled Windows Tasks](/posts/kestrel-2021-07-01): we monitor a Windows host
with [Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon),
stream the logs to [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) via
[winlogbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/master/winlogbeat-module-sysmon.html),
[install Kestrel](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
in a Python virtual environment, install the *elastic_ecs* connector of
STIX-shifter, and setup
[STIX-shifter](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/kestrel_datasource_stixshifter.interface.html)
to access data.

### <a name="section:startip"></a>Entity-based Reasoning From An IP Address

Sysmon traces Windows activities and stores individual events as
[records](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#record) in
Elasticsearch. Reasoning on records directly requires excessive knowledge of
record semantics, which gets worse when querying multiple data sources with
different record formats. Kestrel runtime identifies
[entities](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#entity) in
records and automatically collects all available information about entities in
related records before presenting the complete view of entities to the user.
We only need to hunt in terms of entities, e.g., creating a [Kestrel
variable](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#kestrel-variable)
from an IP address,
[finding](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#find) all
processes connected to that IP address. This [entity-based hunting
approach](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#entity-based-reasoning)
makes it easy for a human to organize hunts, pivot from one hunt step to
another, and enables [composable huntflow
development](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#composable-hunt-flow).

In this hunting practice, we start from an IP address `72.21.81.200` and walk
the process tree connecting to it to reason about the suspiciousness of the IP.

First, let's create a Kestrel variable with the starting IP address as an entity:

```elixir
ip200 = GET ipv4-addr FROM stixshifter://host101
        WHERE [ipv4-addr:value = '72.21.81.200']
        START t'2021-04-01T00:00:00Z' STOP t'2021-04-06T00:00:00Z'
```

We specify the type of entity `ipv4-addr` we'd like to get from the monitored
Windows host `host101` and describe the matching criteria in STIX pattern
`[ipv4-addr:value = '72.21.81.200']`. We limit the time of search for the first
5 days in April to not boil the ocean of logs. The time range is required in
our first `GET` command in a huntflow. Otherwise, STIX-shifter will default the
time range to the past five minutes.

If you have setup multiple data sources besides `host101`, you can use
auto-complete in Kestrel to list all available data sources by pressing `TAB`
after `stixshifter://`.

![Kestrel first block execution
summary](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_ip200_summary.png)

After putting the command in a Jupyter cell and execute, we get the execution
summary of the code block---one IP address entity and 350 records/logs, each of
which has some information about the IP. We don't bother with the number of
records since we are doing entity-based reasoning and Kestrel will assemble the
entity from the 350 records for us.

### <a name="section:ip2process"></a>Obtaining Associated Network-Traffic And Processes

Before we jump from an IP address entity to one or more process entities, we
need to obtain the pivot entity in between---*network-traffic*. The Kestrel
entity ontology is based on [STIX
SCOs](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/csprd01/stix-v2.1-csprd01.html#_Toc16070567),
and it is described in the [FIND command
syntax](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#find), which is
the command we use to get connected entities, e.g., `ipv4-addr` entities to
`network-traffic` entities; `network-traffic` entities to `process` entities.

According to the relation chart in the [FIND command
syntax](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#find), we use
relation `ACCEPTED BY` to indicate the IP in `ip200` is the destination IP of
the `network-traffic` to return. Then we use relation `CREATED` to indicate
the `network-traffic` is associated with the `process` to return. We use `DISP`
command to print select attributes of the entities in a Kestrel variable. Now
let's put all the four commands in a code block to be executed in a Jupyter
Notebook cell:

```elixir
# obtain network traffic that has ip200 as the destination IP
ip200nt = FIND network-traffic ACCEPTED BY ip200
DISP ip200nt ATTR src_ref.value, src_port, dst_ref.value, dst_port

# obtain processes creating the network traffic
p = FIND process CREATED ip200nt
DISP p ATTR pid, name, command_line
```

We get back 350 network traffic in `ip200nt` and 34 processes in `p`. Here's a
partial list of all network traffic in `ip200nt` out of the 350 entities.

![Kestrel network traffic detailed
results](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_ip200nt_details.png)

We may want to list only the distinguished destination port to get an idea
of whether this is just HTTPS (port 443) traffic. We can execute another `DISP`
command in an empty cell. If we are not sure which attributes to list, we can
always do `INFO ip200nt` first.

```elixir
DISP ip200nt ATTR dst_ref.value, dst_port
```

![Kestrel network traffic brief
results](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_ip200nt_brief.png)

Kestrel automatically deduplicates repeated results so we only see one line of
results, which confirms our guess that all traffic going to the IP is to its
port 443.

Then let's scroll up to check the second output from our previous command `DISP
p` where we show partial results again since the full list of 34 processes is
long:

![Kestrel first process detailed
results](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_p_results.png)

All 34 processes in Kestrel variable `p` connects to `72.21.81.200:443` as we
discovered. We can pick up the first process `BackgroundDownload.exe` to start
our process tree walk for further understanding of activities on the Windows
host.

### <a name="section:backtracking"></a>Walking Up The Process Tree of *BackgroundDownload.exe*

Backward tracking is a hunting strategy to walk back the control-flow or
data-flow of entities to understand their origin or provenance. The most common
task for given process entities is to backtrack their control-flow and *walk up
the process tree* to check whether given processes are created by a malicious
process.

Let's take a close look at a subset of processes with the name
`BackgroundDownload.exe` in `p`. From their command line, we can guess they are
benign and belong to Microsoft Visual Studio. Let's check their parent process
to see which process create them.

```elixir
# get a subset of entities from variable `p`
bgdownloads = GET process FROM p WHERE [process:name = 'BackgroundDownload.exe']

# obtain parent processes of bgdownloads
bgdp = FIND process CREATED bgdownloads
DISP bgdp ATTR pid, name, command_line
```

![Kestrel parent process bgdp detailed
results](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_bgdp_results.png)

We get 4 `BackgroundDownload.exe` processes from `p` and 3 processes as their
parent processes.  From the parent process names and executable paths, we are
more confident `BackgroundDownload.exe` processes are part of Microsoft Visual
Studio and spawned by processes from the suite.

Next, let's see if we can trace back one level up to find the grandparent
processes:

```elixir
# grandparent processes of `BackgroundDownload.exe`
bgdpp = FIND process CREATED bgdp
```

![Kestrel parent process bgdpp
summary](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_bgdpp_summary.png)

Good, we see two processes, and Kestrel also gets back some records with network
activities when trying to get the most complete information of the
entities---there are 146 *network traffic* records related to the two
processes. However, this is only a summary of the command execution, and we are
not sure whether the *network traffic* are directly or indirectly linked to the
grandparent processes. Let's print out details of the grandparent processes and
the network traffic:

```elixir
DISP bgdpp ATTR pid, name, command_line

bgdppnt = FIND network-traffic CREATED BY bgdpp
DISP bgdppnt ATTR src_ref.value, src_port, dst_ref.value, dst_port
```

![Kestrel parent process bgdpp
details](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_bgdpp_details.png)

Zero network activities: the 146 related `network-traffic` records cached could
be indirectly associated with the process in `bgdpp` such as their parent or
child processes.


It is easy to guess the `devenv.exe` in `bgdp` is spawned from `explorer.exe`
in `bgdpp` (likely a double click by a human user); `svchost.exe` is spawned
from `services.exe`. We can choose the former to verify:

```elixir
bgdp_devenv = GET process FROM bgdp WHERE [process:name = 'devenv.exe']
bgdp_devenv_parent = FIND process CREATED bgdp_devenv
DISP bgdp_devenv_parent ATTR pid, name, command_line
```

![Kestrel process devenv
details](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_devenv_details.png)

Bingo. And we can walk the process chain up of `bgdp_devenv_parent`:

```elixir
# Let's go further up to pull out parent process of `bgdp_devenv_parent`.
ppp = FIND process CREATED bgdp_devenv_parent
DISP ppp ATTR pid, name, command_line
```

![Kestrel process devenv_parent_
details](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_devenv_parent_details.png)

The `explorer.exe` is spawned by `svchost.exe -k DcomLaunch -p`, which is the
Windows DCOM Server Process Launcher and this behavior is expected. The DCOM
launcher is the *great grandparent* of `BackgroundDownload.exe` and it is one
of the core Windows system services. We could stop here, but we can also try to
trace back further to see what is the limit of the Sysmon monitor regarding its
visibility into the very early phase of system bootup---of course, Sysmon can
only see things after itself is started/spawned by a Windows service process.

```elixir
# Let's see how far we can go to the origin of the process tree in sysmon
pppp = FIND process CREATED ppp
DISP pppp ATTR pid, name, command_line
```

![Kestrel process pppp
summary](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_pppp_summary.png)

OK. We actually just hit the limit of Sysmon, which does not log the birth of
`ppp`.

### <a name="section:forwardtracking"></a>Forward Tracking From *iexplore.exe*

After backward tracking and finding some interesting crotches in the process
tree, we can perform forward tracking, or *walk down the tree*, to check other
activities from the crotch entities. This is a common hunting strategy to
understand impacts of an entity.

We start from processes that talk to IP address `72.21.81.200`, and we already
have all such processes in variable `p`. Let's list all process names in `p`:

```elixir
DISP p ATTR name
```

![Kestrel process p names](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_p_names.png)

In the last section, we hunt mostly around `BackgroundDownload.exe` and we can
walk down the process tree from its parent process in `bgdp`. We can also go
beyond the process tree for further forward tracking, e.g., finding network
traffic and IP addresses associated with processes.

Let's try it: start from the `iexplore.exe` processes in the above list to (i)
walk down its process tree, and (ii) go beyond the process tree to network
activities at leaf processes.

```elixir
# first walk down the tree from the iexplore processes in `p`
ie = GET process FROM p WHERE [process:name = 'iexplore.exe']
DISP ie ATTR pid, name, command_line

ie_children = FIND process CREATED BY ie
DISP ie_children ATTR pid, name, command_line
```

![Kestrel ie details](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_ie_and_children.png)

As shown in the execution summary, Kestrel variable `ie` contains two process
entities with pid 7356 and 11368. There is only one process in `ie_children`
with pid 8508.

```elixir
# second let's go beyond the process tree for network activities of the child process
ient = FIND network-traffic CREATED BY ie_children
DISP ient ATTR dst_ref.value, dst_port
```

![Kestrel ie child network traffic](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_ie_child_nt.png)

### <a name="section:analytics"></a>Entity Enrichment With Kestrel Analytics

We find 76 network traffic entities from the IE process with pid 8508 shown
above, all of which looks like web connections. However, could a malicious C&C
sever hide itself in the list? Usually attackers do not use IP addresses
directly for C&C, but domain names created by domain generation algorithms
(DGA). If we can enrich the IP addresses with their domain names, we may
discover something malicious.

Enriching entities is another type of hunting steps besides pattern matching,
and Kestrel enables it as *analytics*---the second way of encoding hunting
knowledge besides patterns.

The analytics we are using here is
[domainnamelookup](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-analytics/tree/release/analytics/domainnamelookup)
in [Kestrel analytics
repository](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-analytics). It
is a Kestrel analytics via [docker](https://www.docker.com/) interface. To use
the analytics, first clone the repo and go to the _domainnamelookup_ analytics
directory. Then do docker build:

```bash
$ docker build -t kestrel-analytics-enrichdomain .
```

The analytics is now available as *enrichdomain* in Kestrel. Kestrel calls
analytics in its `APPLY` command (more details in
[documentation](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#apply)).
After typing `APPLY docker://`, we can press `TAB` to list all available
analytics. If *enrichdomain* does not show up, restart the Jupyter kernel to
re-initialize the Kestrel kernel and its analytics interface manager.

```elixir
# next let's apply the analytics to all entities in `ient`.
APPLY docker://enrichdomain ON ient

# print out all attributes including the ones added/enriched by `enrichdomain`
INFO ient
```

![Kestrel ie child network
traffic](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_ient_details.png)

Looking for attributes about domain name, we find two attributes newly added by
the analytics: *x_domain_name*, *x_domain_organization*. Then we can print:

```elixir
DISP ient ATTR dst_ref.value, dst_port, x_domain_name, x_domain_organization
```

![Kestrel ie child network
traffic domains](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_ient_domains.png)

No domain names here look like generated by naive DGA (examples from the
article [Domain Generation Algorithms -- Why so
effective?](https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/domain-generation-algorithms-effective)).
Not bad to rule out a threat.

### Stretch Hunts

More can be done by backward and forward tracking the control-flow (through the
process tree) and data-flow (through files) and apply other analytics in the
hunts.

1. Kestrel 1.0 has only process--executable relation for files, which is not
   very powerful for data-flow tracking. Future Kestrel will support STIX 2.1
   with SRO with universal file types support for more powerful data-flow
   tracking.

2. In the [Kestrel analytics
   repository](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-analytics),
   there is an example analytics [SANS IP
   Enrichment](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-analytics/tree/release/analytics/sansipenrich)
   that enriches network traffic entities with IOC information provided by
   [SANS](https://isc.sans.edu/api/#openiocsources).

3. It is easy to build your own analytics, and more information can be found
   with the [analytics
   template](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-analytics/tree/release/template)
   for the Kestrel docker analytics interface.
