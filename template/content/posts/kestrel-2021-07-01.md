*This blog covers installation, setup, and initial hunting steps development in
[Kestrel](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang) to reason
from Scheduled Windows Tasks for discovering persistent Windows threats.*

### Kestrel Installation

We follow the [Kestrel Installation
Guideline](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) to
install Kestrel in a Python virtual environment on a Linux hunting box running
Fedora 33 (Python 3.9).

We first create a clean Python virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
$ python -m venv huntingspace
$ . huntingspace/bin/activate
```

We then install Kestrel runtime with its Jupyter notebook kernel:
```bash
$ pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
$ pip install kestrel-jupyter
$ python -m kestrel_jupyter_kernel.setup
```

This step will install all Kestrel runtime and its dependencies such as
[STIX-shifter](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/stix-shifter) as
well as [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to use the Kestrel kernel.

### Data Source Setup

We monitor Windows hosts with
[Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) and
use
[winlogbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/master/winlogbeat-module-sysmon.html)
to stream events into [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) for log
management. Logs in Elasticsearch are
[records](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#record), on
top of which Kestrel provides an abstraction to do [entity-based
reasoning](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#entity-based-reasoning)
and enables dynamic
[huntflow](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#composable-hunt-flow)
development and sharing.

Kestrel connects to data sources with an extensible set of
[interfaces](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#data-and-analytics-interfaces).
The major one we will use today is its [STIX-shifter
interface](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/kestrel_datasource_stixshifter.interface.html).
STIX-shifter enables data retrieval from various data sources, including data
in [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/ecs) (used by
winlogbeat by default) stored at an Elasticsearch server. In the previous
Kestrel installation step, STIX-shifter framework is installed but not
including dozens of its
[connectors](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/stix-shifter/blob/develop/OVERVIEW.md#available-connectors).
The user needs to choose which connector to install based on their available
data sources. Let's install the connector for our Sysmon-Elasticsearch(ECS)
data pipeline:

```bash
$ pip install stix-shifter-modules-elastic_ecs
```

We may have many Windows hosts monitored with log stored in the Elasticsearch
service. Usually people assign different Elasticsearch indexes for logs from
different monitor hosts so they can be queried separately. Next we need to
configure Kestrel regarding available data sources. One Kestrel data source can
map to data from one or multiple monitored Windows host(s) based on the
configuration. The configuration also tells Kestrel how to access the
Elasticsearch service with hostname and credentials like API keys.

We open a new terminal, activate the Python venv with Kestrel, and export three
environment variables to setup a Kestrel data source named `host101` (more
information can be found at [Kestrel
tutorial](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#kestrel-jupyter):

```bash
$ . huntingspace/bin/activate
$ export STIXSHIFTER_HOST101_CONNECTOR=elastic_ecs
$ export STIXSHIFTER_HOST101_CONNECTION='{"host":"elastic.securitylog.company.com", "port":9200, "indices":"host101"}'
$ export STIXSHIFTER_HOST101_CONFIG='{"auth":{"id":"VuaCfGcBCdbkQm-e5aOx", "api_key":"ui2lp2axTNmsyakw9tvNnw"}}'
```

### Start Jupyter And Create A New Huntbook

Next just start Jupyter notebook in the above terminal with our Kestrel data
source configuration (exported environment variables):

```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```

On the Jupyter page in browser, we create an empty Kestrel huntbook by choosing
the `Kestrel` kernel under the dropdown menu of *New Notebooks*.

![Kestrel Jupyter New Huntbook](/images/kestrel_jupyter_new_huntbook.jpg)

A [Kestrel
huntbook](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#hunt-book) is
a Jupyter notebook that contains hunting steps (in
[Kestrel](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html)), the
execution results, and instructions or thoughts (in
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)). In each notebook cell, we can put
any number of consecutive Kestrel statements/commands, which forms a Kestrel
code block to be executed together. After executing each cell, Kestrel runtime
will give a summary of new variables created in that cell and statistics on
associated logs/records retrieved and cached by the runtime. Notebook cells can
be re-executed or executed out of order in notebook. Jupyter will give an
execution ID left to the cell to indicate the execution order of cells. Note
that if one or more Kestrel variables in a cell depend on the execution of
another cell, the dependent cell or code block needs to be executed first, or
Kestrel will give an error that the variable does not exist in the current
session.

### Getting The List of Windows Scheduled Tasks

In this hunt, we will start drilling down from the list of Windows scheduled
tasks/services to hunt persistent threats like
[FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046/). In recent Windows (>= Windows
10 version 1511), scheduled tasks are executed and managed by `svchost.exe`
with a specific argument `-k netsvcs -p -s Schedule`. The tasks are spawned
from the `svchost.exe` processes as child processes at scheduled time. This
understanding written by [Nasreddine
Bencherchali](https://nasbench.medium.com/) in his
[blog](https://nasbench.medium.com/a-deep-dive-into-windows-scheduled-tasks-and-the-processes-running-them-218d1eed4cce)
provides us an idea to view Windows scheduled tasks as process entities, which
can be found by their parents `svchost.exe` processes.
