*This blog covers installation, setup, and initial hunting steps development in
[Kestrel](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang) to reason
from Scheduled Windows Tasks for discovering persistent Windows threats.*

### Kestrel Installation

We follow the [Kestrel Installation
Guideline](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) to
install Kestrel in a Python virtual environment on a Linux hunting box running
Fedora 33 (Python 3.9).

We first create a clean Python virtual environment and activate it:

```
$ python -m venv huntingspace
$ . huntingspace/bin/activate
```

We then install Kestrel runtime with its Jupyter notebook kernel:
```
$ pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
$ pip install kestrel-jupyter
$ python -m kestrel_jupyter_kernel.setup
```

This step will install all Kestrel runtime and its dependencies such as
[STIX-shifter](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/stix-shifter) as
well as [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to use the Kestrel kernel.

### Data Source Setup

We monitor Windows hosts with
[Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) and
use
[winlogbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/master/winlogbeat-module-sysmon.html)
to stream events into [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) for log
management. Logs in Elasticsearch are
[records](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#record), on
top of which Kestrel provides an abstraction to do [entity-based
reasoning](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#entity-based-reasoning)
and enables dynamic
[huntflow](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#composable-hunt-flow)
development and sharing.

Kestrel connects to data sources with an extensible set of
[interfaces](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#data-and-analytics-interfaces).
The major one we will use today is its [STIX-shifter
interface](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/kestrel_datasource_stixshifter.interface.html).
STIX-shifter enables data retrieval from various data sources, including data
in [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/ecs) (used by
winlogbeat by default) stored at an Elasticsearch server. In the previous
Kestrel installation step, STIX-shifter framework is installed but not
including dozens of its
[connectors](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/stix-shifter/blob/develop/OVERVIEW.md#available-connectors).
The user needs to choose which connector to install based on their avaliable
data sources. Let's install the connector for our Sysmon-Elasticsearch(ECS)
data pipeline:

```
$ pip install stix-shifter-modules-elastic_ecs
```

We may have many Windows hosts monitored with log stored in the Elasticsearch
service. Usually people assign different Elasticsearch indexes for logs from
different monitor hosts so they can be queried seperately. Next we need to
configure Kestrel regarding avaliable data sources. One Kestrel data source can
map to data from one or mutliple monitored Windows host(s) based on the
configuration. The configuration also tells Kestrel how to access the
Elasticsearch service with hostname and credentials like API keys.

We open a new terminal, activate the Python venv with Kestrel, and export three
environment variables to setup a Kestrel data source named `host101` (more
information can be found at [Kestrel
turotial](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#kestrel-jupyter):

```
$ . huntingspace/bin/activate
$ export STIXSHIFTER_HOST101_CONNECTOR=elastic_ecs
$ export STIXSHIFTER_HOST101_CONNECTION='{"host":"elastic.securitylog.company.com", "port":9200, "indices":"host101"}'
$ export STIXSHIFTER_HOST101_CONFIG='{"auth":{"id":"VuaCfGcBCdbkQm-e5aOx", "api_key":"ui2lp2axTNmsyakw9tvNnw"}}'
```

### Start Jupyter And Create A New Huntbook

Next just start jupyter notebook in the above terminal with our Kestrel data
source configuration (exported environment variables):

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

On the Jupyter page in browser, we create an empty Kestrel huntbook by choosing
the `Kestrel` kernel under the dropdown menu of *New Notebooks*.
